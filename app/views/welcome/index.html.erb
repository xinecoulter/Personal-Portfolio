    <p>And I'm a biomedical engineer turned web developer. Does that sound odd? Maybe.</p>
    <p>Long story short...</p>
    <p>I grew up in Long Island, earned my bachelor's degree in biomedical engineering at the University of   Virginia ("Wahoowa!"), and returned to New York to work as a researcher at Weill Cornell Medical College. I spent 5.5 years researching kidney transplantation there while simultaneously working towards my master's degree (also in biomedical engineering) at the Polytechnic Institute of New York University.</p>
    <p>...Then I took a detour. My husband began working as an iOS developer and I envied him. The enjoyment he felt from problem-solving and coding is what inspired me consider web development as a new career. So, I decided to participate in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program where I fell in love with coding and building web apps using Ruby on Rails and JavaScript.</p>
    <p>Ta-da!</p>
